                 in 1868�69. The narrative concerns the unsettling effect of the �primitive� Prince Myshkin on the 
                 sophisticated, conservative Yepanchin family and their friends. Myshkin visits the Yepanchins, and
                 his odd manner and lack of concern for appearances quickly make him an object of fascination.
                 His hosts, who are given to sensuality, acquisitiveness, and crime, test his moral compass. Myshkin 
                 maintains a guileless benevolence toward all, but, though his faith and radiant personality
                 draw them to him, his message of service, compassion, and brotherly love finally fails.",
